Lab 1, problem 4

Problem: The problem was to make two lists of students for two seperate classes, then find the students attending both classes and the students who are only attending one class.

Solution:  I started by initializing two lists of students, then I made the lists sets to make comparisons easier.

Output:
"C:\Users\Katie Williams\PycharmProjects\Lab1\venv\Scripts\python.exe" "C:/Users/Katie Williams/PycharmProjects/Lab1/Four.py"
{'Diana Prince', 'Natasha Romanov', 'Bruce Wayne'}
 are the students attending both classes
{'Tony Stark', 'Bruce Banner', 'Clark Kent'}
 are the students not attending both classes

Process finished with exit code 0
