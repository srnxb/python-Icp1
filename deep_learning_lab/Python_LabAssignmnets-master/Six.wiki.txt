Lab 1, problem 6

Problem: The problem was to use NumPy to create a random list of numbers then to output the number that appears the most times.

Solution:  I used NumPy to generate a list of random numbers, then I used the NumPy function bincount() to make another list of how frequently each number in the range appeared.  I then iterated through the list to find the highest number in the list of frequencies.

Output:
"C:\Users\Katie Williams\PycharmProjects\Lab1\venv\Scripts\python.exe" "C:/Users/Katie Williams/PycharmProjects/Lab1/Six.py"
The list is [ 3 19 19  7  0 10  0 16  8  9  2  9  3 13 13]
The most frequent number is 19

Process finished with exit code 0
