Lab 1 problem 2

Problem:  The problem here was to take in a sentence from the user and 1) output the middle word in the sentence, 2) output the longest word iinthe sentence, and 3) to write the sentence backward.

Solution:  I started by asking for a sentence from the user.  I then used a split fucntion to find the middle word, a for loop to find the longest word, and the extended slice syntax to output the sentence backwards.

Output:
"C:\Users\Katie Williams\PycharmProjects\Lab1\venv\Scripts\python.exe" "C:/Users/Katie Williams/PycharmProjects/Lab1/Two.py"
Please enter your sentence: Hello world my name is Kate
The middle words are my, name
The longest word is Hello
